Understood. We can definitely enhance the "Financial Overview" and "Metrics" sections (which are now rendered via `ResponsiveContentDisplay` as an Accordion on mobile and a Grid of Cards on desktop).

To help me propose the most effective improvements, could you please specify what aspects you'd like to work on for these cards? For example:

*   **Visuals/Aesthetics:** Do you want to change colors, fonts, spacing, layout within the cards?
*   **Content Display:** Should they show more or less information? Different types of data?
*   **Interactivity:** Any new actions or hover effects?
*   **Data Representation:** Should the summary cards include sparklines, progress bars, or other visual data summaries?
*   **Ordering/Grouping:** Should the cards within these sections be reordered or grouped differently?

Knowing your specific goals will help me provide concrete and implementation-ready recommendations.
